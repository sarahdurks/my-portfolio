## User Story

> AS AN employer
> I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
> SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
> WHEN I load their portfolio
> THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
> WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
> THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
> WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
> THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
> WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
> THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
> WHEN I click on the images of the applications
> THEN I am taken to that deployed application
> WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
> THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
